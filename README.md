# PostgreSQL-Comparator
This is a Desktop Application Built on Python for Comparing the Structural Differences Between Similar Databases Running on Different Servers or Different Instances of PostgreSQL.

The Application will List out all the Structural Discrepancies between two PostgreSQL Databases. The Application will be useful where there are need to maintain multiple PostgreSQL Development Environment's.

One Example for such a scenario is During a Product Develoment, Developers and Testers might use different Database Environments to perform their Routine, This application will help the Developers and Testers to Maintain the Structural Integrity between their Databases by providing the user with a list of all the Structural Discrepancies between two PostgreSQL Databases.

The Results of the Comparison will be written to a text file which is to be selected by the user.

Currently the Application has a simple Graphical User Interface built with the help of the Python Module EasyGui 3.3.8(built on TKinter).

I am further working on improving the Application's User Interface and More Features.
